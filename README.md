# Workspace Shortcut

This is a simple extension that will make the process of changing workspaces easier.

Just configure the available folders and use the commands "ctrl+alt+numpadN" to go to the respective folder (N represents the order of the folders in the settings).

**Attention**: You can have up to 9 quick shortcuts.

To open a list with all configured folders, use the shortcut "ctrl+alt+numpad0".

### 1.0.0

Initial release (and probably the only change).
